# Hello, World! 🌍 I'm Andrew Godinez

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a tech enthusiast and professional pivoting from **Infrastructure & Data Center Operations** to **Information Security**, **Application Development**, and **AI-driven automation**. My focus? Building secure, intelligent apps for mobile, desktop, and web—while automating security tasks to make client-side machines smarter and safer.

Currently, I’m deep in the **Microsoft**, **Apple**, and **Google developer programs**, leveraging their tools and communities to create cutting-edge solutions. When I’m not coding, I’m hacking (ethically!) on platforms like **Hack The Box**, **Juice Shop**, and **DVWA**.

## 💡 What I’m Focused On
- **Cross-Platform App Development**: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS—secure, user-friendly, and accessible.
- **Web App Security**: Pen testing, secure coding, and threat modeling to build resilient systems.
- **AI-Powered Security Automation**: Intelligent agents for real-time threat detection, patching, and adaptive access controls.
- **Collaboration**: Open to projects, feedback, and partnerships. Let’s build something impactful!
